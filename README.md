# Deep Learning Specialization

Welcome to the **Deep Learning Specialization** repository!

This repository contains comprehensive resources, assignments, and notes based on the Deep Learning Specialization curriculum. It is organized into five main courses, each focusing on a core aspect of deep learning, with practical Jupyter Notebooks and supporting materials.

## 📚 Courses

- **Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning**  
  Foundations of deep learning, understanding neural networks, forward/backward propagation.

- **Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization**  
  Techniques to make your models work better in practice, including tuning and regularization.

- **Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects**  
  Best practices for organizing and structuring machine learning projects for performance and scalability.

- **Course 4: Convolutional Neural Network**  
  Deep learning for computer vision: CNN architectures, applications, and practical tips.

- **Course 5: Sequence Model**  
  Understanding and building models for sequence data, such as RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Narcolepsyy/Deep_learning_specialization.git
   cd Deep_learning_specialization
   ```

2. **Set up your Python environment:**  
   It is recommended to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or `venv`.

3. **Install required libraries:**  
   Most notebooks use popular packages such as NumPy, TensorFlow, and Keras.  
   Install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If a requirements file is provided in the relevant course folder)*

4. **Start learning:**  
   Open the notebooks in your favorite environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, VSCode).
